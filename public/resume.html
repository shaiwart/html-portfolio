                    <p>
                        This project is designed so as to be used by car Rental Company specializing in renting cars to customers. 
                        It is an online system through which customers can view available cars, 
                        register, view profile and book car. In this project Spring boot, 
                        JPA and MySql database is used as middle-tier and back-end. ReactJs 
                        is used to desing the front-end.

                    <h3>Basic Characteristics of Dual Phase Steel</h3>
                    <p>
                        A study has been made on the effect of heat treatment on mild steel 
                        at three different temperatures to form dual- phase steel.Further, to 
                        analyze the properties in a better manner, DP Steels were formed at different 
                        temperatures. Welding, SEM, XRD, Rockwell hardness, and Wear tests have been 
                        performed in order to show how the dual-phase steel is better than mild steel in 
                        terms of microstructure, hardness, wear resistance, and welding characteristics.
